# pynsee 0.2.1

**Bugfixes**

* support parquet files in downloads (#257)
* correct column handling in ``get_series_list`` (#259)
* correct documentation about ``init_conn`` (#260)

# pynsee 0.2.0

**Breaking changes**

The INSEE APIs were changed, including

* new API portal: portail-api.insee.fr
* no token generation is needed for all APIs except SIRENE
* for SIRENE API, it is now provided via the ``sirene_key`` argument in ``init_conn``
* ``get_included_area`` was removed

**Deprecations**

* ``GeoFrDataFrame.translate`` is deprecated in favor of ``GeoFrDataFrame.transform_overseas``
* ``GeoFrDataFrame.get_geom`` is deprecated in favor of ``GeoFrDataFrame.geometry.union_all``

**New features**

* ``GeoFrDataFrame`` inherits from ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame`` so you can use all the included methods directly on it (#246)
* the tranlation and zoom of overseas department has be renamed ``transform_overseas``
* the configuration file is no longer stored in the middle of the home directory (#210)

**Documentation**

* updated examples and user guides (#246 #250 #251)
* internal links for functions and classes (#251)
* link to pandas/geopandas/pyproj and request documentations (#251)

**Under the hood**

* use data from Melodi api (#229)
* backend function update in the utils module + sirene functions update
* cleanup of temporary files handling (#206)
* all cached data is now saved as parquet for faster read/write operations (#199 #208 #224)
* switch to multithreading instead of multiprocessing (#216)
* move to pyproject.toml only (#243)
* fix tests and cleanup imports (many commits)
* enforce black formatting (#234)
